# Monitoring Reproduction Number for Coronavirus Outbreaks

 R-code to implement the estimation of time-varying reproduction rates
 as in Thompson et.al. (2019)"Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious
 disease outbreaks" Epidemics (29) 2019.

 The underlying tools of the EpiEstim package are is described 
 Anne Cori, Neil M. Ferguson, Christophe Fraser and Simon Cauchemez  (2013).
 "A New Framework and Software to Estimate Time-Varying Reproduction Numbers During Epidemics" 
 American Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 178, Issue 9.

Estimates for the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval were obtained from:

 Hiroshi Nishiura, Natalie M. Linton, Andrei R. Akhmetzhanov (2020) 
 "Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections",
 International Journal of Infectious Diseases, Volume 93.
